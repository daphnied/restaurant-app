#### _Restaurant Reviews App_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This project was created at part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program. A static webpage was converted to a mobile-ready web application. The app is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.


### Run the application

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000'

### Note about ES6
